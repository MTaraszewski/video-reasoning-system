# Image lifecycle. Two images, two jobs:
#   finder  — CPU only, built here: decode, window, merge, schema, CLI, eval
#   vllm    — pinned upstream image, holds the weights and nothing else

.PHONY: build pull shell clean down

build: preflight  ## [any] build the finder image
	$(COMPOSE) build finder

pull:  ## [gpu] pull the pinned vLLM image (large — do this before you need it)
	docker pull $(VLLM_IMAGE)

shell: ## [any] open a shell in the finder container
	$(FINDER_RUN) --entrypoint bash finder

down:  ## [any] stop all containers
	$(COMPOSE) down

clean: down  ## [any] stop containers and drop generated output (keeps the weight cache)
	rm -rf $(OUT_DIR)
	@echo "Removed $(OUT_DIR). The weight cache volume is kept — use 'make clean-weights' to drop it."

clean-weights:  ## [any] drop the model weight cache volume (forces a re-download)
